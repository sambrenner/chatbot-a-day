Chatbot a Day
============

I'm building a chatbot a day (almost). Currently they all live as static pages in the `public` directory. This repo also contains a server that I'll be using to add the illusion of intelligence to new chatbots.

[Go chat with some of them now](http://chatbots.herokuapp.com) or run the server yourself:

1. `git clone https://github.com/sambrenner/chatbot-a-day.git`
* `npm install`
* `node app`
* [Visit the server](http://localhost:3000/)
