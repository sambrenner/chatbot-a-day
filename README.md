Adventures of Teen Bloggers
============

Adventures of Teen Bloggers is a game that lets you re-animate the forgotten online identities of thousands of former adolescent bloggers and vicariously experience their innermost thoughts.

Play the game [here](http://teenbloggers.net)!

It is my thesis project at [NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/) in the Spring of 2014. Live everything, it's a work in progress. [Here are some of my next steps](https://github.com/sambrenner/teenbloggers/issues?state=open). Full documentation to come.
